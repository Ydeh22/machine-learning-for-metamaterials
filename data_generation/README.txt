Data generation script to generate sample systems using the TMM.

Run the data_generation_tmm.ipynb file in jupyter notebook in the same
directory as the auxiliary files. Produces a h5 file with a predetermined
number of sample systems. Different data can be generated by modifying the
parameters in the script where indicated.

Folder Contents:
- generate_data_tmm.ipynb: main script to generate the data for machine
                learning, using iterative calls to the TMM_numba.py module.
                Run this script with sufficent memory, as examples are held
                in memory before written to file. This is a faster process
                and works well with ~250k examples on 16gb RAM. Parmaters can
                be altered in file.

- Data/data_rte_gen<N>lay5mat_100n_v-tma.h5: 100 example systems generated from the data
                generation script. Can be used to test the methods in this
                repository without excessive overhead for data generation.
                <N> refers to the total layer number, and scripts should be
                matched with the corresponding data file in layer number.

- auxiliary files: see /auxiliary_scripts/README.txt for an explanation of 
                each file and correct usage.
